Code from https://github.com/dhconnelly/paip-python

The **General Problem Solver** is a framework for applying *means-ends analysis*
to solve problems that can be specified by a list of initial states, a list of
goal states, and a list of operators that induce state transitions.

Each operator is specified by an action name, a list of precondition states that
must hold before the operator is applied, a list of states that will hold after
the operator is applied (the *add-list*), and a list of states that will no
longer hold after the operator is applied (the *delete-list*).  To achieve a
goal state, GPS uses means-ends analysis: each operator is examined to find one
that contains the goal state in its add-list (it looks for an *appropriate*
operator).  It then tries to achieve all of that operator's precondition states.
If not all of the preconditions can be achieved (the operator is not
*applicable*), then GPS looks for another appropriate operator.  If none exists,
then the goal can't be achieved.  When all of the goal states have been
achieved, the problem is solved.

The following programs demonstrate using GPS to solve some famous AI problems:

- [Monkey and Bananas](monkeys.html)
- [Blocks World](blocksworld.html)

This implementation is inspired by chapter 4 of "Paradigms of Artificial
Intelligence Programming" by Peter Norvig.
