If you can play the game further given a game state, you game state representation is acceptable.

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "While *Minimax* is great for computing a move, it can get tricky when the number of game states gets bigger. The algorithm needs to search all the leaves of the tree, which increase exponentially to its depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Tic-Tac-Toe, where the depth of the tree is 9 (after the 9th move, the game ends), we can have at most 9! terminal states (at most because not all terminal nodes are at the last level of the tree; some are higher up because the game ended before the 9th move). This isn't so bad, but for more complex problems like chess, we have over $10^{40}$ terminal nodes. Unfortunately we have not found a way to cut the exponent away, but we nevertheless have found ways to alleviate the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we examine *pruning* the game tree, which means removing parts of it that we do not need to examine. The particular type of pruning is called *alpha-beta*, and the search in whole is called *alpha-beta search*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase what parts of the tree we don't need to search, we will take a look at the example `Fig52Game`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example game, we need to find the best move for player MAX at state A, which is the maximum value of MIN's possible moves at successor states.\n",
    "\n",
    "`MAX(A) = MAX( MIN(B), MIN(C), MIN(D) )`\n",
    "\n",
    "`MIN(B)` is the minimum of 3, 12, 8 which is 3. So the above formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "`MAX(A) = MAX( 3, MIN(C), MIN(D) )`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next move we will check is c1, which leads to a terminal state with utility of 2. Before we continue searching under state C, let's pop back into our formula with the new value:\n",
    "\n",
    "`MAX(A) = MAX( 3, MIN(2, c2, .... cN), MIN(D) )`\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know how many moves state C allows, but we know that the first one results in a value of 2. Do we need to keep searching under C? The answer is no. The value MIN will pick on C will at most be 2. Since MAX already has the option to pick something greater than that, 3 from B, he does not need to keep searching under C.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *alpha-beta* we make use of two additional parameters for each state/node, *a* and *b*, that describe bounds on the possible moves. The parameter *a* denotes the best choice (highest value) for MAX along that path, while *b* denotes the best choice (lowest value) for MIN. As we go along we update *a* and *b* and prune a node branch when the value of the node is worse than the value of *a* and *b* for MAX and MIN respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, after the search under state B, MAX had an *a* value of 3. So, when searching node C we found a value less than that, 2, we stopped searching under C.\n",
