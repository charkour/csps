In fact, with enough data we can categorize correctly mostly any text. That is because different languages have certain characteristics that set them apart. For example, in German it is very usual for 'c' to be followed by 'h' while in English we see 't' followed by 'h' a lot.\n",

    "Now it is time to build our new Naive Bayes Learner. It is very similar to the one found in `learning.py`, but with an important difference: it doesn't classify an example, but instead returns the probability of the example belonging to each class. This will allow us to not only see to whom a paper belongs to, but also the probability of authorship as well. \n",
    "We will build two versions of Learners, one will multiply probabilities as is and other will add the logarithms of them.\n",

    "Finally, since we are dealing with long text and the string of probability multiplications is long, we will end up with the results being rounded to 0 due to floating point underflow. To work around this problem we will use the built-in Python library `decimal`, which allows as to set decimal precision to much larger than normal.\n",
