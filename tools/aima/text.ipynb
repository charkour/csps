    "## TEXT MODELS\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start analyzing text processing algorithms, we will need to build some language models. Those models serve as a look-up table for character or word probabilities (depending on the type of model). These models can give us the probabilities of words or character sequences appearing in text. Take as example \"the\". Text models can give us the probability of \"the\", *P(\"the\")*, either as a word or as a sequence of characters (\"t\" followed by \"h\" followed by \"e\"). The first representation is called \"word model\" and deals with words as distinct objects, while the second is a \"character model\" and deals with sequences of characters as objects. Note that we can specify the number of words or the length of the char sequences to better suit our needs. So, given that number of words equals 2, we have probabilities in the form *P(word1, word2)*. For example, *P(\"of\", \"the\")*. For char models, we do the same but for chars.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also useful to store the conditional probabilities of words given preceding words. That means, given we found the words \"of\" and \"the\", what is the chance the next word will be \"world\"? More formally, *P(\"world\"|\"of\", \"the\")*. Generalizing, *P(Wi|Wi-1, Wi-2, ... , Wi-n)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call the word model *N-Gram Word Model* (from the Greek \"gram\", the root of \"write\", or the word for \"letter\") and the char model *N-Gram Character Model*. In the special case where *N* is 1, we call the models *Unigram Word Model* and *Unigram Character Model* respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `text` module we implement the two models (both their unigram and n-gram variants) by inheriting from the `CountingProbDist` from `learning.py`. Note that `CountingProbDist` does not return the actual probability of each object, but the number of times it appears in our test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For word models we have `UnigramWordModel` and `NgramWordModel`. We supply them with a text file and they show the frequency of the different words. We have `UnigramCharModel` and `NgramCharModel` for the character models.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With **Information Retrieval (IR)** we find documents that are relevant to a user's needs for information. A popular example is a web search engine, which finds and presents to a user pages relevant to a query. Information retrieval is not limited only to returning documents though, but can also be used for other type of queries. For example, answering questions when the query is a question, returning information when the query is a concept, and many other applications. An IR system is comprised of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A body (called corpus) of documents: A collection of documents, where the IR will work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A query language: A query represents what the user wants.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Results: The documents the system grades as relevant to a user's query and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Presententation of the results: How the results are presented to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does an IR system determine which documents are relevant though? We can sign a document as relevant if all the words in the query appear in it, and sign it as irrelevant otherwise. We can even extend the query language to support boolean operations (for example, \"paint AND brush\") and then sign as relevant the outcome of the query for the document. This technique though does not give a level of relevancy. All the documents are either relevant or irrelevant, but in reality some documents are more relevant than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, instead of a boolean relevancy system, we use a *scoring function*. There are many scoring functions around for many different situations. One of the most used takes into account the frequency of the words appearing in a document, the frequency of a word appearing across documents (for example, the word \"a\" appears a lot, so it is not very important) and the length of a document (since large documents will have higher occurrences for the query terms, but a short document with a lot of occurrences seems very relevant). We combine these properties in a formula and we get a numeric score for each document, so we can then quantify relevancy and pick the best documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scoring functions are not perfect though and there is room for improvement. For instance, for the above scoring function we assume each word is independent. That is not the case though, since words can share meaning. For example, the words \"painter\" and \"painters\" are closely related. If in a query we have the word \"painter\" and in a document the word \"painters\" appears a lot, this might be an indication that the document is relevant but we are missing out since we are only looking for \"painter\". There are a lot of ways to combat this. One of them is to reduce the query and document words into their stems. For example, both \"painter\" and \"painters\" have \"paint\" as their stem form. This can improve slightly the performance of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine how good an IR system is, we give the system a set of queries (for which we know the relevant pages beforehand) and record the results. The two measures for performance are *precision* and *recall*. Precision measures the proportion of result documents that actually are relevant. Recall measures the proportion of relevant documents (which, as mentioned before, we know in advance) appearing in the result documents."

So the system failed us and presented us an irrelevant document. Why is that? Unfortunately our IR system considers each word independent. \"Remove\" and \"delete\" have similar meanings, but since they are different words our system will not make the connection. So, the `diff` manual which mentions a lot the word `delete` gets the nod ahead of other manuals, while the `rm` one isn't in the result set since it doesn't use the word at all."

    "\n",
    "**Information Extraction (IE)** is a method for finding occurrences of object classes and relationships in text. Unlike IR systems, an IE system includes (limited) notions of syntax and semantics. While it is difficult to extract object information in a general setting, for more specific domains the system is very useful. One model of an IE system makes use of templates that match with strings in a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical example of such a model is reading prices from web pages. Prices usually appear after a dollar and consist of numbers, maybe followed by two decimal points. Before the price, usually there will appear a string like \"price:\". Let's build a sample template.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the following regular expression (*regex*) we can extract prices from text:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[$][0-9]+([.][0-9][0-9])?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `+` means 1 or more occurrences and `?` means atmost 1 occurrence. Usually a template consists of a prefix, a target and a postfix regex. In this template, the prefix regex can be \"price:\", the target regex can be the above regex and the postfix regex can be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A template can match with multiple strings. If this is the case, we need a way to resolve the multiple matches. Instead of having just one template, we can use multiple templates (ordered by priority) and pick the match from the highest-priority template. We can also use other ways to pick. For the dollar example, we can pick the match closer to the numerical half of the highest match. For the text \"Price $90, special offer $70, shipping $5\" we would pick \"$70\" since it is closer to the half of the highest match (\"$90\")."

    "* **Probabilistic**: Using Hidden Markov Models, we can extract information in the form of prefix, target and postfix from a given text. Two advantages of using HMMs over templates is that we can train HMMs from data and don't need to design elaborate templates, and that a probabilistic approach behaves well even with noise. In a regex, if one character is off, we do not have a match, while with a probabilistic approach we have a smoother process.\n",

    "* **Conditional Random Fields**: One problem with HMMs is the assumption of state independence. CRFs are very similar to HMMs, but they don't have the latter's constraint. In addition, CRFs make use of *feature functions*, which act as transition weights. For example, if for observation $e_{i}$ and state $x_{i}$ we have $e_{i}$ is \"run\" and $x_{i}$ is the state ATHLETE, we can have $f(x_{i}, e_{i}) = 1$ and equal to 0 otherwise. We can use multiple, overlapping features, and we can even use features for state transitions. Feature functions don't have to be binary (like the above example) but they can be real-valued as well. Also, we can use any $e$ for the function, not just the current observation. To bring it all together, we weigh a transition by the sum of features.\n",
    "\n",

    "Now let us try to decode messages encrypted by a general mono-alphabetic substitution cipher. The letters in the alphabet can be replaced by any permutation of letters. For example, if the alphabet consisted of `{A B C}` then it can be replaced by `{A C B}`, `{B A C}`, `{B C A}`, `{C A B}`, `{C B A}` or even `{A B C}` itself. Suppose we choose the permutation `{C B A}`, then the plain text `\"CAB BA AAC\"` would become `\"ACB BC CCA\"`. We can see that Caesar cipher is also a form of permutation cipher where the permutation is a cyclic permutation. Unlike the Caesar cipher, it is infeasible to try all possible permutations. The number of possible permutations in Latin alphabet is `26!` which is of the order $10^{26}$. We use graph search algorithms to search for a 'good' permutation."

    "Each state/node in the graph is represented as a letter-to-letter map. If there is no mapping for a letter, it means the letter is unchanged in the permutation. These maps are stored as dictionaries. Each dictionary is a 'potential' permutation.  We use the word 'potential' because every dictionary doesn't necessarily represent a valid permutation since a permutation cannot have repeating elements. For example the dictionary `{'A': 'B', 'C': 'X'}` is invalid because `'A'` is replaced by `'B'`, but so is `'B'` because the dictionary doesn't have a mapping for `'B'`. Two dictionaries can also represent the same permutation e.g. `{'A': 'C', 'C': 'A'}` and `{'A': 'C', 'B': 'B', 'C': 'A'}` represent the same permutation where `'A'` and `'C'` are interchanged and all other letters remain unaltered. To ensure that we get a valid permutation, a goal state must map all letters in the alphabet. We also prevent repetitions in the permutation by allowing only those actions which go to a new state/node in which the newly added letter to the dictionary maps to previously unmapped letter. These two rules together ensure that the dictionary of a goal state will represent a valid permutation.\n",

This is because not only the final dictionary, with substitutions for all letters, must have good score but so must the intermediate dictionaries. You could think of it as performing a local search by finding substitutions for each letter one by one. We could get very different results by changing even a single letter because that letter could be a deciding factor for selecting substitution in early stages which snowballs and affects the later stages. To make the search better we can use different definitions of score in different stages and optimize on which letter to substitute first."
